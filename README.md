# Sentiment analysis project

This is the first of several projects I will be undertaking over the next few weeks to months.

Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique that allows one to analyse the emotions expressed in text data. In the context of reviews data, sentiment analysis can help to automatically categorise each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on the language used. By doing this, one can gain insights into the overall sentiment of your users towards your product or service, and identify areas where you may need to make improvements. In this project, I will use a variety of natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of reviews. My goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the sentiment of each review, and to use this model to gain insights into the sentiment of our users.

I will update this as I go.
